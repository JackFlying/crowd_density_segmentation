# Crowd Density & Segmentation Prediction

This project is the implementation and extension of the previous work, which is based on patches. For more details, please refer to the original [paper](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/papers/zhangLWYcvpr15.pdf).

### Requirements: software

[Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) and MATLAB 2014a or above are required. **Notice:** A modified version of Caffe is requried.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```Shell
# Make sure to clone with --recursive
git clone https://github.com/wk910930/crowd_density_segmentation.git
```

2. Build Caffe (Code is **private** for now)

```Shell
# Currently the code is not allowed to be public.
```

### Prepare training data

We will call the directory that you cloned `$CROWD_ROOT`. We have prepared a toy dataset called [dataset_01](data/dataset_01), which is used to demonstrate how to generate training data. Place your own dataset(s) under the [data](data) for further research.

1. Generate density map
    * Go to the [scripts](scripts) folder.
    ```Shell
    cd $CROWD_ROOT/scripts
    ```
    * Run the [gen_density_map.m](scripts/gen_density_map.m). It will generate density map for each frame.
    * Run the [gen_patch.m](scripts/gen_patch.m). It will crop the frames and density maps.
2. Convert to Leveldb
    * Training the model needs three leveldb dataset, *i.e.* `data_db`, `regression_db` and `segment_db`, which stores the frames, segmentation masks and density maps, respectively.
    * Converting to Leveldb needs the Caffe, which is private for now.
    ```Shell
    # Notice:
    #   jpg_id is the file list contains all frame crops, which can be generated by the command `ls sub_frames/*.jpg`. It looks like:
    #       xxxxxxx01.jpg
    #       xxxxxxx02.jpg
    #       xxxxxxx03.jpg
    #       xxxxxxx04.jpg
    #       ...
    #   Similar to png_id and mat id.

    # Example:
    #
    # Convert frame crops to leveldb
    ./caffe/build/tools/convert_imageset.bin -backend leveldb /path/to/sub_frames/ jpg_id data_db
    # Convert segment crops to leveldb
    ./caffe/build/tools/convert_imageset.bin -backend leveldb -gray /path/to/sub_segs/ png_id segment_db
    # Convert density crops to leveldb
    ./caffe/build/tools/convert_matset.bin -backend leveldb -height 256 -width 256 -varname crop_dens /path/to/sub_density/ mat_id regression_db
    ```
